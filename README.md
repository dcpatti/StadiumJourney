# StadiumJourney

Plotting trips to follow your favorite baseball team (once they figure out a contract)

Inspired by my own summer travel planning, this webapp will aid the user in planning an itinerary based on different priorities. Want to see the most teams while traveling the least distance? Want to see your favorite team play in the highest number of stadiums in the shortest number of days? Or trying to see every single team play in at least one game as early in the season as possible? This app (once created) will take you there.

Expected components: python, pandas, plotly, bokeh, OpenStreetMap, and others.
